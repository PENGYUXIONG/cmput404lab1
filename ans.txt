However, according to stackoverflow, it seem that the venv shipped with python3. So I assume, if my local env has python2, the version of python will differ.
On top of that, I found the python location inside the virtual env is relocated. 

What likely happened, is that the venv folder is the storage of the virtual env, by which it also has the copied directories setting.
